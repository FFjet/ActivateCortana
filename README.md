# ActivateCortana
## Introduction
This can activate cortana(English and Chinese) as optional voice in control panel.
It will require adminstrator permissions in order to write the registry successfully using the WINAPIs.
It has no virus, if you are a programmer like me, you can check the source.

## Authors
It is first created by yxlllc using powershell script, but I think that's not easy to use. I made this, which is based on his registry processing procedures, for convenience.

Origin powershell script here:
